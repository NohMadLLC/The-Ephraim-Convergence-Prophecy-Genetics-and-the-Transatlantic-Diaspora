## Purpose

This repository accompanies the white paper titled *"The Ephraim Convergence: Prophecy, Genetics, and the Transatlantic Diaspora"*. It provides a reproducibility protocol for independent researchers to validate the claims using publicly available data.

> **Disclaimer**: This guide assumes you are willing to do your own work. No datasets are hosted here. We point you to the door — you decide if you’ll open it.

## Requirements

* Basic command-line proficiency
* Familiarity with genetic databases, historical archives, and mapping tools
* Python (>=3.9)
* LaTeX (for compiling .tex files)

## Reproducibility Instructions

### 1. Y-DNA Haplogroup Validation

**Goal**: Reconstruct haplogroup distributions (E1b1a, E1b1b, J1, R1b) among African-descended and Israelite-linked populations.

**Sources**:

* YFull Tree: [https://yfull.com](https://yfull.com)
* ISOGG: [https://isogg.org/tree/](https://isogg.org/tree/)
* National Geographic Genographic Project (archived)
* Published datasets from [FamilyTreeDNA](https://www.familytreedna.com/public/)

**Instructions**:

* Use YFull to trace E1b1a and E1b1b phylogeny.
* Cross-reference population studies via ISOGG.
* Match frequency maps against Transatlantic Slave Trade embarkation regions.

### 2. Historical Trade Routes + Population Shifts

**Goal**: Validate that slave ports with high embarkation overlap with E1b1a prevalence and known Israelite exile routes.

**Sources**:

* SlaveVoyages: [https://www.slavevoyages.org](https://www.slavevoyages.org)
* UNESCO Archives
* OpenStreetMap Historical Plugins

**Instructions**:

* Plot embarkation locations using SlaveVoyages data.
* Overlay with known Assyrian and Phoenician trade routes.
* Map correspondence to post-1492 diasporas and colonization trails.

### 3. Linguistic Echoes

**Goal**: Find lexical, phonological, or grammatical evidence of Semitic residue in West African languages.

**Sources**:

* Ethnologue: [https://www.ethnologue.com](https://www.ethnologue.com)
* Glottolog: [https://glottolog.org](https://glottolog.org)
* Linguistic works by Olumide Lucas, Joseph Williams, etc.

**Instructions**:

* Compare Hebrew root patterns to Yoruba, Igbo, Mande phonemes.
* Identify recurring morphemes linked to Israelite phrases (e.g., "Yah," "El")
* Cite overlap in naming conventions, tribal identifiers, and religious vocabulary.

### 4. Cultural Continuity and Forensic Ethnography

**Goal**: Track Torah-aligned customs in West African communities prior to missionary contact.

**Sources**:

* Colonial-era missionary reports
* Anthropological records pre-1800
* Oral traditions archives (e.g., Ifa, Igbo cosmology, Ashanti traditions)

**Instructions**:

* Identify dietary, moral, calendrical, and priesthood practices consistent with Torah.
* Cross-verify descriptions of "Judaic tribes" with European accounts and African oral records.
* Correlate customs like circumcision on the 8th day, menstrual separation, Ark-type shrines.

* `Pandas` and `Matplotlib` for basic data analysis
* `Jupyter Notebooks` for live demonstrations (optional)
* `LaTeX` for compiling and annotating `.tex` files for publication
